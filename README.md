Democratizing Institutional-Grade IPO Allocations for Retail Investors.

IPOVault is a modern FinTech application designed to solve the "Retail IPO Lottery" problem in the Indian stock market. By pooling capital from retail investors, the platform executes large-cap bids under the HNI (High Net-worth Individual) category, mathematically increasing the probability of allotment compared to the standard retail category.

🧐 The Problem

Retail investors in India face a massive disadvantage in IPOs:

Oversubscription: The retail category is often oversubscribed 50x–100x.

The Lottery System: Allotment is purely luck-based; owning capital doesn't guarantee shares.

Idle Funds: Capital sits blocked in ASBA accounts earning minimal to zero returns while waiting for rejection.

💡 The Solution: IPOVault

IPOVault aggregates small ticket sizes (e.g., ₹15k - ₹50k) into multi-crore "Whale Bids."

HNI Category Arbitrage: By bidding as an HNI/NII, we access a quota with better allotment ratios.

Capital-First Model: We prioritize returning user capital first.

Performance Fee: We only earn a 10% fee on Net Realized Profit. If the user doesn't profit, we don't earn.

✨ Key Features

2. AI-Powered Analysis (Powered by Google Gemini)
